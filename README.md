# mIRC-StarkSoftProxy-Log4net-TwitchtvBot
So Basically downloaded, smartIRC4net, project, it contained, starksoft proxy and log4net with IRC implementation, which I have turned into twitch tv bot, although it can be mutipurpose. The project name is "Test".
It has one problem though, not really a problem, there is a twitch account "cloakersBot" with OAuth token with chat scope, so if you want your bot to join some other channel, you need to change it in the code, I am just lazy to make some solution for that. But yeah this works and that's it. Done.
